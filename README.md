## Inspiration
We all spoke about our personal experience with our formal education in Financial Literacy. Only one member of our group took a course on this back in high school. This motivated us to create FinLITT: an educational app meant to help bridge this gap.

## What it does
The FinLITT application is designed to be a personalized learning experience. It requires users to first sign in and select their interests. Doing so helps the application improve its recommendations. After that, the user is asked a simple yes-or-no question about whether or not they have knowledge about their selected topic. The learning application will adapt depending upon their response.

## How we built it
We built this using a Python web-framework called [Pynecone](https://pynecone.io/). It is a relatively new framework and was fun to work with. However, it has some limitations that we didn't not forsee being an issue.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the largest challegnes for us was narrowing the scope of operations. We took our time deciding on a project, but settling on it was only half the battle! We also struggled to figure out what would incentivize youth to view videos and go through the adaptive, personalized learning system on our app. Another challenge was the new Pynecone framework; as mentioned above, there were many limitations we did not see coming.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We finished and submitted!
- Some of our team members completed their first Hackathon!

## What we learned
- New technologies
- Power of teamwork
- Challenges of compromise

## What's next for FinLITT
- AI that will help of further personalization of the recommended videos and scenarios. 
- Expand demographic so that older adult learners may also benefit from financial wellness information on the app.
- Repair system that we are navigating in through policy that requires financial literacy be taught in all schools, from as soon as middle school.
